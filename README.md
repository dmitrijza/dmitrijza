## W. D. Dmytro

#### I'm not that eloquent in English to freely describe what I have done or what I'm capable of, by the way, that would be pretty boring for you to read. Instead, I would like just to quote Nietzsche, as it's pretty self-describing. 
#### "If you go to see a woman, you must not forget the whip." - Nietzsche, Zarathustra.
