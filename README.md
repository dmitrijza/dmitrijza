## W. D. Dmytro

#### I'm not that eloquent in English to freely describe what I had done or what I'm capable of, by the way, that would be pretty boring for you to read. Instead, I would like just to quote Nietzsche instead, as it's pretty self-describing. 
#### "If you go to see a woman, you must not forget the whip." - Nietzsche, Zarathustra.  
#### Have been working alongside with Java since very 2016s.
